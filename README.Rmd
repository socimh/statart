The primary goal of statart is to migrate some useful commands (functions) from Stata to R. Functions are built in the tidyverse framework, including

-   `tab()` and `tab1()` for frequency tables (like `tab` and `tab1` in Stata)
-   `fre()` for frequency tables with missing information (like `fre` in Stata)
-   `summ()` for summary statistics (like `summarize` in Stata)
-   `codebook()` for codebook (like `codebook` in Stata)
